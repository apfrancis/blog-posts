Hack days at Acuris
Hack days are an integral part of the engineering and product development culture at Acuris. Having recently passed our 50th hack day we'll discuss how we run hack days, why we do them and the great things that have come out of them.
What do we use them for?
We see hack days as a great way to generate and develop ideas for the business, promote collaboration across product teams and foster an environment of continuous learning and improvement.
The History
Our hack days began as multi-day events held infrequently over the course of a year. The sole focus was to bootstrap new product or feature ideas which meant that the output was always a working prototype of some kind. 
Since then we've iterated the format and now conduct hack days every 2 weeks. Hack days are now a blend between traditional hackathlons  and 10% time allocated for professional development. 
The rules? There are no rules!
There are some guidelines...
We're conscious that hack days should be for the benefit of the participants, and that benefitting the participants also benefits the business. In order to provide some structure to the hack days we created the following guidelines
Hack days are optional.
 
We found that not everyone wanted to participate in hack days all of the time, and it wouldn't be feasible for the product development team to 'down tools' for a day every two weeks. We expect the participants to be fresh and motivated, so if you've got other work to do, or you just don't feel like it, that's absolutely fine.
Hack days aren't just for engineers.

We encourage the other areas of Product Development to participate in hack days. Some of the best hacks have been produced by cross-discipline teams. *shadowing different disciplines..*
3. Work on a project, or on your professional development
If you want to work on a side project then do so, if you want to do an online course, thats cool! As long as you can find some business or personal development benefit then you can work on whatever you want.
Actually, the 3 points above are just guidelines. The only real RULE is this one.
4. You must create a slide which details what you will be working on, and attend a presentation at the end of the day.
You don't need to 'present' your slide if you don't want to, but you must attend and be willing to discuss what you did with the other participants.
oh, and.
5. Everyone gets applause
The Slides
In the days leading up to the hack day a slide deck is circulated. The deck contains slides of different colours which signify the type of hack.
Green. Suggestions from the business that could be hacked on. These provide topics that engineers and other members of product development can take forward and present.
Pink. Well formed ideas with specific requirements from the business. The output of these slides is usually a proof of concept that will be shown to customers to validate the idea. Depending on the idea, hackers working on these slides might be given extra time to develop a prototype. 
Blue. A hack with a demo that can be shared. e.g. "I worked on a Tetris clone in Clojure, it's awesome!"
Orange. A hack without a demo. e.g. "I continued my udemy course on machine learning. Today I learned about training sets."

Slides from participants are created in advance of the day itself. That way natural teams emerge around a particular hack subject. 
The Presentations
We have a facilitator for each hack day who is responsible for running through the slides and keeping the session on track. We understand that presentations aren't for everyone, and it's absolutely fine for your slide to be read out by the facilitator.
Measuring success
Hack days account for 10% of a working week, a significant investment. We're conscious to keep monitoring and iterating on the hack day format to ensure that we're getting the most out of them. 
Hack days continue to be well attended and enjoyable for participants.
Participants feel that they are levelling up professionally as a result of hack days. 
Using hack days to learn and evaluate languages has pervaded adoption in the business. i.e. Node to Go for some services. React/Redux.

Show me the things!
During the writing of this blog post I went back over the previous 50 or so hack day presentations. Each presentation is stored, and most demos have code in github, so we have an archive of the brilliant work our hackers have done. Here are just a few examples:
Automated support calendar - See who is on support this week
In-Pipeline frontend performance tests with Google Lighthouse
A dependancy manager for node packages
Dynamic Datadog graph / monitor creation using Terraform
Kill List - Working on removing 'old tech'
Wildebeest - Reminding you that you've not deployed your latest features
Jirabot - Get Slack messages about Jira tickets by mentioning the ticket number 

In addition to 'things' we've built, hack days have also influenced the adoption of new technologies.
Performance testing of Node vs Golang resulted in some services being rewritten in Go.
